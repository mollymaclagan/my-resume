<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Professional Statement</h2>
<p>
    I hope the selected employment history on my <a href="../index.html">résumé</a> 
    speaks for itself, but I’d like to fill in the blanks a bit. If I were to 
    assign myself a headline, it might be:
</p>

<blockquote><b>I am a high school dropout who went on to eventually earn a master’s 
    degree.</b></blockquote>

<p>
    (In other words, I am persistent.) But beyond that, I am passionately eclectic. 
    The bulk of my career has been in the nonprofit sector, and has spanned property
    and casualty insurance, tech support, theatrical direction and dramaturgy,
    educational program management, fundraising, technical project management, and
    content creation in the health and wellness space.
</p>

<p>
    Each of these spheres may seem unrelated, but I am confident that pursuing my 
    curiosity with passion has led me to exactly where I should be professionally. 
    Doing so taught me to learn quickly and rapidly pivot in response to stimuli. 
    In addition it, has also allowed me to identify and leverage unexpected 
    connections between seemingly disparate fields. Every position has allowed 
    me to engage with new concepts and provided me with a wide (and deep) variety 
    of professional experiences. Finally, this breadth of experience has 
    introduced me to new communities, providing me with the opportunity to 
    interact with people from all walks of life and challenging me to live my 
    values of engaging with differing (and even contradictory) perspectives.

<h2>The Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>
    I joke that conversations with me are like potato chips: you can't have just one.
    In sincerity, engaging and connecting with people is one of life's great
    joys, and one I try to indulge whenever possible. Conversation is just one way to
    connect with others. Communities can be found and created anywhere
    and building one just requires identifying common ground to get started.
